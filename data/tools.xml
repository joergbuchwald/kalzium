		<name>Watchglass</name>
		<desc>Watchglasses are round glass panes with a diameter of around 5 - 10cm, used in various experimental techniques. The border is bent upwards to allow the watchglass to hold small amounts of liquids in order to let them evaporate. The evaporation can be accelerated by heating the watchglass with a Bunsen burner. Watchglasses can also be used to cover Petri dishes or beakers, and are also suited to weighing small amounts of matter or drying them in an airing cupboard. The term watchglass is derived from the former pocket watches' protection glass which was often domed.</desc>

		<name>Dehydrator</name>
		<desc>A dehydrator is a piece of laboratory apparatus, often made of glass, and which serves to dry chemical matters; that is, to remove water or liquid from a sample.
			In principle it is a glass bowl with cap that has a planar grinding, so that the bowl is air-tight. The dehydrator's lower part is ordinarily filled with a drying agent such as calcium chloride, silica gel, phosphoric anhydride or sulphuric acid. The sample to be dried is placed on a diaphanous cartridge of plastic or ceramic above the drying agent.
			The drying agent is hygroscopic, which means that it dehumidifies its environment by absorbing water vapor. The dry atmosphere then takes up water from the sample to be dried.</desc>

		<name>Water Jet Pump</name>
		<desc>The water jet pump has two entry pipes and one exit, and consists, in principle, of two pipes one inside the other. At the water entry a water jet shoots under full pressure out of a nozzle into a slightly larger pipe. The water jet thereby carries away air or fluid from the second entry. &lt;br&gt; This is caused by the negative pressure in a drifting fluid, and thus it is an application of the hydrodynamic paradox (objects close to drifting fluids are aspirated instead of being pushed away).</desc>

		<name>Heating Coil</name>
		<desc>Heating coils are used to heat flasks and other containers. Multiple heating coils can be connected with a thermometer so that the heat will not exceed a specified temperature. It is possible to use a magnetic field inside the heating coil to stir fluids with a magnetic stirrer. This will homogenize the fluid in terms of temperature and composition.</desc>

		<name>Vortexer</name>
		<desc>A vortexer serves to homogenize reagents found in laboratories. The container containing liquid to be homogenized is put on a platform. The platform shakes by rotary agitation up to 3000RPM at which point a contact sensor is activated. In this way extremely small volumes of fluid can be homogenized quickly. It is the opposite of a centrifuge, used to separate fluids.</desc>

		<name>Rotary Evaporator</name>
		<desc>A rotary evaporator consists of a round flask in a bath of hot water, and is designed to evaporate solvents. The flask is rotated and the solvent collects under a vacuum onto a condenser and drips into a condensate collecting flask. In this way solutions can be concentrated or purified. By attaching a vacuum pump, the air pressure and therefore the boiling point of the fluid can be decreased.</desc>

		<name>Reflux Condenser</name>
		<desc>A reflux condenser subjects fluid to a process where a gas produced by heating is collected on the reflux condenser. The fluid is cooled until it condenses and runs back into the original fluid. Usually it is put on a round-bottomed flask or several neck flasks.</desc>

		<name>Pipette</name>
		<desc>Pipettes are used to introduce small quantities of liquids in laboratories. A pipette has a volume scale and, as a rule, pipette bulbs are used as droppers for liquids. Both sorts of pipettes are calibrated for fluids with a temperature of 20Â°C and for time of outflow (signified by "Ex."). If needed, times of outflow are indicated on the pipettes.</desc>

		<name>Erlenmeyer Flask</name>
		<desc>An Erlenmeyer flask, named after the chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909), is different to a beaker in that it comes with an inverted conical base and a cylindrical neck. There are different types of Erlenmeyer flasks for laboratory applications: the narrow neck and wide neck forms. Depending on the application the flask may have precision grinding to allow good connection to other containers.
			&lt;br&gt;
			The narrow neck reduces the risk of fluid escaping, especially when boiling or during reactions which agitate the contents.
			&lt;br&gt;
			An Erlenmeyer flask is useful for mixing fluids or accelerating reactions by stirring or shaking, for example. The Erlenmeyer flask is particularly suited for a magnetic stirrer, since it can be placed directly on the stirring platform. A round-bottomed flask, by contrast, must be placed on a cork ring on the stirring platform.

		<name>Ultrasonic Bath</name>
		<desc>For some chemical reactions it is important that the solvent is gas free. To achieve this the reaction vessel is put for some time into a ultrasonic bath. Due to the high sound frequency, the vapor locks peel away and ascend. This procedure is called out-gassing.</desc>

		<name>Distillation bridge</name>
		<desc>One means of separating a mixture is to use distillation. In this setting, a distillation bridge acts as a conduit between the two pots. One pot contains the mixture to be separated, and through heating, a gas forms which is lead through the bridge. At the end of the bridge the gas phase is condensed and drips into a round flask. Typically, the bridge is cooled by return flow. Also, there is often a thermometer for controlling the temperature of the distillation bridge.</desc>

		<name>Syringe</name>
		<desc>A syringe consists of two parts, a glass tube and a plunger, both normally made of glass. Gasses flow into the glass tube, and as the syringe is a closed system, the plunger moves outwards. This can be used to measure the volume of a reaction.</desc>

		<desc>First, four small caps are placed at the four ends of the separation beaker. Then, whilst distilling, the beaker is turned by 60 degrees after a certain temperate has been reached. In doing so, at the end of the distillation, all four caps contain a specific liquid, depending on the boiling point of the liquid distilled.</desc>

		<name>Contact Thermometer</name>
		<desc>Contact thermometers differ from regular thermometers in that they are connected to a heating coil, and are hence able to both sense and control the current temperature. In doing so, they allow experiments to be performed under a constant temperature. Contact thermometers work using a negative feedback loop: once the desired temperature has been reached, the heating coil is deactivated; when the temperature falls, the heating coil is reactivated.</desc>

		<name>Indicator Paper</name>
		<desc>There are multiple ways of measuring the pH value of a solution, one of which is to use indicator paper. Indicator paper changes color depending on the pH of the solution applied to it, and by comparing to a chart a fairly accurate measure of the solution's pH can be obtained. If a more accurate measure is needed, a glass electrode can be used, which works by measuring the conductivity of the solution.</desc>

		<name>Buret</name>
		<desc>Burets are used to titrate liquids. A buret is filled with a specific volume of a liquid, and placed beneath it is a container such as an Erlenmeyer flask. By opening the valve on the buret, the liquid in the container will then be titrated. High-quality burets have a venting mechanism with which they can be very easily refilled with the exact volume for which the buret is calibrated.</desc>
